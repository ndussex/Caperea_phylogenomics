## Genome consensus building

The [bcftools_consensus_genome.bsh](bcftools_consensus_genome.bsh) script uses a bcf file and an assembly to build a new consensus genome

## SNP calling

This is recorded [SNPCalling_clean.md](SNPCalling_clean.md) that includes masking and splitting all the way to one file per window with all species.

## Tree building

Saved as one file in [build_trees_clean.md](build_trees_clean.md) that includes the astral analysis. Astral visualisations are not included, but scripts are availabe upon request.

## PSMC

The [bcftools_consensus_genome.bsh](bcftools_consensus_genome.bsh) is used to split a bam file into diplois.fastq file which is then used as input in the [Pygmy_whale_PSMC_bootstrap.bsh](Pygmy_whale_PSMC_bootstrap.bsh) to run the PSMC.

## Molecular dating

The [molecular-dating.md](molecular-dating.md) script contains all the information to repeat the molecular dating analysis.
